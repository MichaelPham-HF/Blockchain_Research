Reproducible Codes for Research (sentiment analysis, scraping methods, and other pipelines)

The set of codes in this project is meant to demonstrate the methodology, conducted in the research titled "Media Sentiment and Economic Signals of Emerging Blockchain Adoption in Vietnam."

Currently, the repository only comprises reproducible code. In the future, the repository will provide open-source datasets when the research is published. 

If you have any questions regarding the pipelines, please contact me via email: minhphamgia889@gmail.com

Here is a step-by-step code repository:
1. Scraping Articles
2. Translation Articles
3. Sentiment Analysis
4. EDA before Time Series
5. Time Series Visuals
6. Pearson Correlation

NOTE: The Python VSCode environment may not allow certain transformer modules. If such a problem occurs, please use an alternative code environment such as Google Colab. Also, the code serves as a basic framework for reproduction; therefore, procedures such as merging the datasets or re-ordering the columns of the dataframes are not available.
